2.Write a program which accept principle, rate and time from user and print the simple interest. The formula to calculate simple interest is: simple interest = principle x rate x time / 100

3.Write a program that prompts the user to enter number in two variables and swap the contents of the variables.

4. Write a program that prompts the user to input the radius of a circle and outputs the area and circumference of the circle.The formula is
Area = pi x radius2
Circumference = 2 x pi x radius

5.Write a program which prompts the user to input principal, rate and time and calculate compound interest. The formula is : CI = P(1+R/100) ** T - P.

6.Write a python program to calculate volume of sphare. The formula is given below,
V = 4/3 * PI * r * r *r
and calculate area of sphare. The formula is given below,
V = 4 * PI * r * r
